I understand the installation process can be confusing (refer to issue #49), but I believe this will make it much easier.

This commit adds a precompiled uEmacs binary to simplify packaging and improve distro compatibility.  
Just download it with:

  wget https://bionicbeaverlinux2.github.io/uemacs-precompiled/uemacs-precompiled.tar.gz

or

  curl -LO https://bionicbeaverlinux2.github.io/uemacs-precompiled/uemacs-precompiled.tar.gz

Extract it wherever you like:

  tar -xvf uemacs-precompiled.tar.gz

Then simply run:

  ./ed

It’s a small change, but it saves everyone from having to rebuild the editor from source and improves compatibility across distros.

Thanks,  
Have a great day!
